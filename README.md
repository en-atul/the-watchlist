## **About** 📺

- **Centralized Access**: Quickly open Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, Prime Video, and more—all from one app.
- **Simple Interface**: Minimal design to focus on what matters—watching your favorite content.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **For Fun**: Built as an exploration project, but it could solve a real problem for some users.
